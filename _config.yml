  I am a recent graduate from Columbia Engineering with experience in Applied Physics and Applied Statistics. 
  I have channeled my innate passion for problem solving into honing the skills required to extract value from data 
  and have developed a particular interest in the application of data analytics tools in energy solutions.  
  I am currently working on additional data analytics projects and looking for further opportunities to develop my skills.
