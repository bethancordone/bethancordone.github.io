  I am a recent graduate from Columbia Engineering with experience in Applied Physics and Applied Statistics. 
  Throughout my educational journey I have channeled my innate passion for problem solving into honing the skills required to extract knowledge and solutions from data. 
  Through my Applied Physics background, I have developed a particular interest in the application of data analytics tools in energy solutions.

  I am currently working on additional data analytics projects and looking for additional opportunities to develop my skills.
